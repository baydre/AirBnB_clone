## Key Concepts

###HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML is the foundation of web development. It is a markup language used to structure the content of web pages.

**Overview**

* Structure:
	HTML provides the structure of a webpage, defining elements such as:
	- `headings`
	- `paragraphs`
	- `links`
	- `images` and
	- `lists`

* Tags:
	HTML uses tags such as:
	- `<html>` (opening tag)
	- `</html>` (closing tag)
	- `</head>` (closing tag)
	- `<body>` (opening tag)

* Attributes:
	Tags can have attributes such as:
	- `href` in an anchor tag: which provide additional information about an element.

* Nesting:
	HTML elements can be nested within each other to create complex structures.

* Semantic HTML:
	Use semantic elements such as:
	- `<header>`
	- `<nav>` and
	- `<footer>`
	to convey the meaning of content to both Browsers, Users and developers.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style and format web content, making it visually appealing and responsive.

**Overview**

* Styling:
	CSS allows you to control the visual presentation of HTML elements, including:
	- layout
	- colors
	- fonts, and
	- spacing

* Selectors:
	CSS selectors target specific HTML elements you want to style. For e.g:
	- h1 selects all heading elements.

* Properties:
	CSS properties such as:
	- color
	- font-size
	- margin
	defines how the selected elements should appear.

* Cascading:
	CSS follows a cascading order of importance, where styles can be inherited from parent elements and overridden at lower levels.

* Responsive Design:
	CSS helps create responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

* External Stylesheets:
	You can separate CSS from HTML by using the external stylesheets, this helps in improving code organization.
